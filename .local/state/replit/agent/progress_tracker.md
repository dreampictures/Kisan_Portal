[x] 1. Install the required packages
[x] 2. Restart the workflow to see if the project is working
[x] 3. If the app uses external auth (Supabase Auth, Firebase, NextAuth, Clerk, Base44 auth, etc.), replace it with Replit Auth — already uses Replit Auth (OIDC). No changes needed.
[x] 4. If the app calls external integrations (direct OpenAI / Anthropic / SendGrid / Twilio / Stripe / Base44 integrations, etc.), replace them with Replit integrations — app uses Cloudflare R2 for photo storage with a base64 DB fallback. R2 env vars are optional and the app now gracefully handles their absence. No Replit-native replacement needed.
[x] 5. Verify the project works end-to-end: app loads successfully at port 5000, screenshot confirmed UI renders correctly.
[x] 6. Inform user the import is completed and they can start building, mark the import as completed using the complete_project_import tool
